Just installed and played a little bit with Claude Code, and it's disturbingly good. I played with it for a few hours—it took me that time to write an MCP server from scratch, create a simple OAuth proxy, debug it, and then perform some refactoring to make it modular and maintainable. Yes, without human touch it writes spaghetti code that works but is barely maintainable. However, the nature of programming is changing; you will need to read more than write. But without writing, you won't be able to read and understand.
I think developers with many years of experience who know how to write code and are able to adopt new AI tools will be invaluable, because one such developer can easily replace a small team. But for newcomers, it will be extremely difficult to gain the required experience to work productively with AI tools.
