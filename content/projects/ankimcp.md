I built an MCP server that connects AI assistants to Anki flashcards. It's written in TypeScript with NestJS and works in two modes - local STDIO for Claude Desktop and HTTP streaming for web-based AI tools. The server lets you review cards, manage decks, and work with notes just by chatting with your AI assistant. You can read the full documentation at [ankimcp.ai](https://ankimcp.ai) and check out the source code at [github.com/anki-mcp-organization/anki-mcp-desktop](https://github.com/anki-mcp-organization/anki-mcp-desktop).
